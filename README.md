##To Do application in django Python

This is a to do website designed in python using django framework
A basic application which includes raw SQL and mainly focused on back-end.

This Django-based task management application highlights my strong focus on backend development and database management. By utilizing Django's ORM capabilities alongside raw SQL queries, I have efficiently implemented task creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion functionalities. The raw SQL queries can be seen in views.py where the funcions call for specific task does the corresponding Queries written.
The Front end is also managed by base.html which connects index.html, the main front end part to the project.
